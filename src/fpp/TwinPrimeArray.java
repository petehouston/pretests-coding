//    Consider the prime number 11. Note that 13 is also a prime and 13 â€“ 11 = 2. So, 11 and 13 are known as twin primes.
//    Similarly, 29 and 31 are twin primes. So is 71 and 73. However, there are many primes for which there is no twin.
//    Examples are 23, 67. A twin array is defined to an array which every prime that has a twin appear with a twin.
//    Some examples are
//        {3, 5, 8, 10, 27}, 	     // 3 and 5 are twins and both are present
//        {11, 9, 12, 13, 23},       // 11 and 13 are twins and both are present, 23 has no twin
//        {5, 3, 14, 7, 18, 67}.      // 3 and 5 are twins, 5 and 7 are twins, 67 has no twin
//
//    The following are NOT twin arrays:
//
//        {13, 14, 15, 3, 5} 	 // 13 has a twin prime and it is missing in the array
//        {1, 17, 8, 25, 67}     // 17 has a twin prime and it is missing in the array
